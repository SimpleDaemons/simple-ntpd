  - `make help`: Concise main help with essential targets only
  - `make help-all`: Comprehensive reference with all available targets
  - Category-specific help targets:
    - `make help-build`: Build and development targets
    - `make help-package`: Package creation targets with platform-specific examples
    - `make help-deps`: Dependency management targets
    - `make help-service`: Service management targets with platform support info
    - `make help-docker`: Docker targets
    - `make help-config`: Configuration management targets
    - `make help-platform`: Platform-specific targets and information

- **Docker Infrastructure**: Complete cross-platform build system using Docker
  - Multi-stage Dockerfile supporting Ubuntu, CentOS, and Alpine Linux
  - Multi-architecture support (x86_64, arm64, armv7)
  - Separate targets for development, runtime, and building
  - Docker Compose configuration with build profiles
  - Automated build script (`scripts/build-docker.sh`)
  - Build cache management and volume mounting
  - Non-root runtime container with proper security practices
  - Health checks and container orchestration

- **Enhanced Dependency Management**: Improved development tool installation
  - Fixed `dev-deps` target to use correct package names
  - Made semgrep optional to handle installation failures gracefully
  - Added Homebrew alternative for macOS development tools
  - Better error handling and user feedback

- **Security Scanning Improvements**: Enhanced security analysis capabilities
  - Graceful handling of missing semgrep installation
  - Bandit security scanning for Python code
  - Semgrep static analysis (when available)
  - Clear installation instructions for missing tools

### Changed
- **Makefile Organization**: Restructured help system for better navigation
  - Reduced cognitive load with concise main help
  - Added platform-aware help content
  - Improved examples and usage instructions
  - Better categorization of targets by functionality

- **Development Workflow**: Streamlined development process
  - Fixed package name issues in dependency installation
  - Improved error messages and user guidance
  - Better integration between different build targets

### Fixed
- **Dependency Installation**: Resolved issues with development tool installation
  - Fixed `py3-bandit` package name to `bandit` for MacPorts
  - Made semgrep installation optional to prevent build failures
  - Improved error handling in security-scan target

- **Code Quality**: Enhanced static analysis and formatting
  - Fixed clang-format availability issues
  - Improved cppcheck integration
  - Better handling of missing development tools

### Technical Details

#### Help System Improvements
- **Before**: Single long help output with all targets mixed together
- **After**: Modular system with categorized help targets
- **Benefits**: Easier navigation, reduced information overload, better user experience

#### Docker Infrastructure
- **Multi-stage builds**: Separate stages for different distributions
- **Cross-platform support**: Ubuntu, CentOS, Alpine Linux
- **Multi-architecture**: x86_64, arm64, armv7 support
- **Security**: Non-root containers, proper permissions
- **Efficiency**: Shared layers, build caching, parallel builds

#### Dependency Management
- **Platform-specific**: Different package managers for different platforms
- **Fallback options**: Multiple installation methods (MacPorts, Homebrew)
- **Error handling**: Graceful degradation when tools are unavailable
- **User guidance**: Clear instructions for manual installation

### Usage Examples

#### New Help System
```bash
# Quick reference
make help

# Complete reference
make help-all

# Category-specific help
make help-package    # Package creation targets
make help-service    # Service management targets
make help-deps       # Dependency management targets
make help-build      # Build and development targets
make help-docker     # Docker targets
make help-config     # Configuration management targets
make help-platform   # Platform-specific targets
```

#### Docker Build System
```bash
# Build for all distributions
./scripts/build-docker.sh -d all

# Build for specific distribution
./scripts/build-docker.sh -d ubuntu

# Development environment
docker-compose --profile dev up dev

# Runtime container
docker-compose --profile runtime up simple-ntpd
```

#### Enhanced Development Workflow
```bash
# Install development tools (with fallbacks)
make dev-deps

# Run security scanning (handles missing tools gracefully)
make security-scan

# Format code (now works with proper tool installation)
make format
```

### Files Added
- `Dockerfile`: Multi-stage Docker build configuration
- `docker-compose.yml`: Container orchestration and build profiles
- `scripts/build-docker.sh`: Automated cross-platform build script
- `CHANGELOG.md`: This changelog file

### Files Modified
- `Makefile`: Complete help system reorganization, dependency fixes
- `.PHONY`: Updated to include all new help targets

### Impact
These changes significantly improve the developer experience by:
1. **Reducing complexity**: Modular help system makes it easier to find relevant information
2. **Improving reliability**: Better error handling and fallback options
3. **Enhancing portability**: Docker-based cross-platform building
4. **Streamlining workflow**: Automated build processes and better tool integration
5. **Increasing accessibility**: Clear documentation and examples for all features

### Future Considerations
- Consider adding CI/CD integration using the Docker infrastructure
- Explore additional security scanning tools and configurations
- Evaluate performance optimizations for the Docker build process
- Consider adding automated testing in the Docker environment
